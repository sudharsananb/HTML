    <h1>All About Sudhan</h1>
    <h2><i>Career</i></h2>
    <p>I started my career as a developer in <em><strong>Tata Consultancy services</strong></em> at 12th August 2019.
        Since then working as a <strong>Marklogic Developer</strong> till date. Currently learning
        WebDevelopment to switch my role in a different technology.
    </p>
    <p>I am so passionate about WebDevelopment because I love to do window shopping.
       When I was surfing in the internet, I used to love the websites how they are
       designed and developed. It's all started there.
